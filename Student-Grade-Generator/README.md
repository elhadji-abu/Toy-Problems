#Student Grade Generator
This is a simple program that calculates the grade of a student based on their mark. It was created as a learning exercise for beginners in JavaScript.

##How it Works
The program prompts the user to enter the student's mark (between 0 and 100).
It then calculates the student's grade based on the following rules:
If the mark is greater than 79, the grade is 'A'.
If the mark is between 60 and 79 (inclusive), the grade is 'B'.
If the mark is between 50 and 59 (inclusive), the grade is 'C'.
If the mark is between 40 and 49 (inclusive), the grade is 'D'.
If the mark is less than 40, the grade is 'E'.
The program then displays the calculated grade to the user.

##Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
When prompted, enter the student's mark (between 0 and 100).
The program will display the calculated grade for the student.
Code Explanation

##The program consists of two main functions:

calculateGrade(mark): This function takes the student's mark as an argument and calculates the grade based on the rules mentioned earlier.
studentGradeGenerator(): This function prompts the user for the student's mark, calls the calculateGrade() function, and then displays the results.
The program uses the following JavaScript concepts:

##Functions
Conditional statements (if-else)
User input (prompt())
Console output (console.log())
Getting Started
